/**
 * Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascalâ€™s triangle.
 * Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.
 * <p>
 * In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it
 */

/**
 * Approach:
 * The steps are as follows:
 * <p>
 * 1. We will use a loop(say c) to iterate over each column i.e. from 1 to n. And for each column, we will do the following steps:
     * a. First, we will consider n-1 as n and c-1 as r.
     * b. After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop.
     * c. The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
     * d. Finally, we will print the element.
 *
 * 2. Finally, the entire row will be printed.
